I met a <u>student</u> (at CPCC with WEB115) for about 90 minutes last week and made a <u>recording</u> (with his permission) of the session. There are many almost identical things to what some of you may be working with, and certainly that i've discussed many times in class. Note that this student is not using a webspace with filezilla at all - it's all github desktop. The student also has git incorporated into his VSCode- but everything else should be directly applicable to you and your work. If you do not have your home, introduction, and contract pages all set up, this should be very helpful. Same if you are not yet using github from the client.</p>
