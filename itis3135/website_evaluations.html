                <li><b>Contrast: </b>Good readability. Dark text on light backgrounds. Items are easily differentiable.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition: </b>Same font throughout website. All product pages share same page structure and elements to show features.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment: </b>Items on the page such as features or products are all aligned evenly throughout the page. Everything is centered and cell sizes are the same.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b>Related elements are grouped together such as MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini, etc. On each individual page, features and images are also grouped together.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast: </b>Page is hard to read. The text on the screen doesn't contrast with the background in return making it hard to read.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition: </b>Font is the same throughout pages, but nothing else is really consistent.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment: </b>Alignment is really bad. All elements are stuck to the left side of the page while there is a ton of empty space on the right. Cells are not aligned with eachother.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b>All elements are close to eachother, but they aren't grouped by similarity. Everything is just stuck to the left side of the page.</li>
